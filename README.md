# Jupyter notebook to analyze baseball teams
This notebook sets out to determine if teams are paying too much per win.
I'm a big Detroit Tigers fan and I often think they aren't always getting their money's worth.
This started as a way for me to check our performance agaisnt the Oakland A's (nod to Billy Beane) and the Yankees (big market, big money)
